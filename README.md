## This is not a final version
As for now it's, probably, not as stable as supposed to be, so contributors are welcome,
any help will be appreciated.

## Background information
Initially this license was created for my project called "V A 二 l l A" (Vanilla or va2).

But I modified it so it can now be utilized by others properly.
